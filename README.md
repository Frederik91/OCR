# OCR
Simple MAUI app that lets user draw a letter and uses an OCR model created in ML.Net to predict the letter drawn.

Images to train OCR model were fetched from https://www.kaggle.com/code/yairhadad1/cnn-for-handwritten-alphabets/data.
Project CSVToImage converts the CVS file in kaggle to .gif images in separated folders
